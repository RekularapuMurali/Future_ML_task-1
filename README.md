# Future_ML_task-1
This project is part of my learning journey in Machine Learning. The goal of this task is to predict customer churn (whether a customer will leave or stay) using a Random Forest Classifier.
# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Random Forest  

This repository contains a project developed during my Machine Learning learning path.  
The objective is to **predict customer churn** — determining whether a customer will continue or leave — using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
Customer churn is a major concern for industries like telecom, banking, and subscription-based services.  
Being able to forecast churn helps organizations take preventive actions to improve customer retention.  

In this project, I:  
- Applied **data preprocessing** (missing value handling, encoding, feature scaling).  
- Designed and trained a **Random Forest model** for classification.  
- Assessed performance with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix**.  
- Used **SHAP values** to interpret feature contributions.  

---

## 📂 Main Features  
- Random Forest-based churn prediction  
- Evaluation with standard classification metrics  
- Confusion Matrix visualization for performance insights  
- SHAP plots for explainable AI and feature impact  

---

## 📈 Model Results  
- Reached a test set accuracy of approximately **79%**  
- Identified critical factors like **tenure, contract type, and payment method** as strong indicators of churn  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (Google Colab environment)  
- **Scikit-learn** – model development  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – preprocessing and data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – plotting and visualization  
- **SHAP** – explainability of the ML model  

---

## 📌 Running the Project  
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**  
2. Upload your dataset (`.csv` format)  
3. Execute the cells sequentially to train and analyze the model  

---

## 📷 Example Outputs  
- Confusion Matrix chart  
- Detailed classification report  
- SHAP summary plot for feature importance  

---

## 🌟 Key Learnings  
From this project, I gained practical knowledge on:  
- Preparing datasets for classification tasks  
- Implementing and tuning Random Forest for churn prediction  
- Explaining ML predictions with SHAP
